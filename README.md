# Project SPYN: Autonomous Vehicle Build and Simulation
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to design and build an autonomous vehicle that picks up elderly and disabled people (as represented by a cardboard passenger model), takes them to their destination, and drops them off. For this specific project, an autonomous vehicle prototype must be designed to ensure the safe and efficient transport of a wheelchair-bound model rider from their initial location to their destination within the maze – represented by the blue and green designated areas in the maze, while obeying all “stop signs” – or red stripes on the maze floor. The vehicle must also find its way around the maze with its initial and final destination being the “charging station”, as represented by the yellow square in the maze.<br><br>

This is done by writing software in MATLAB to control the robot’s movement, sensors, and interactions with the passenger model.<br>
