# Project SPYN: Autonomous Vehicle Build and Simulation
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to design and build a robot using the Lego EV3 kit to simulate an autonomous vehicle that could navigate an unknown maze, safely pick up a passenger model made of cardboard, and transport it to another section of the maze while obeying traffic laws (such as stop signs represented by red tape within the maze). <br><br> This is done by writing software in MATLAB to control the robot’s movement, sensors, and interactions with the passenger model.<br>
